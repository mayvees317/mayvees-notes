The challenge.

1. Turn off your phone when you go to bed on Friday night.
2. Don’t turn it back on until you wake up on Sunday morning.
3. During that time, also don’t use your computers to do anything that requires the Internet (I made an exception for playing Rdio).

Kellianne and I tried it yesterday and we ended up having more interesting conversations and more peaceful relaxation times than we’ve had in a while. Will definitely be trying it again next week.

Wanna give it a try? [Join this branch](http://branch.com/b/disconnect-saturdays) to talk about it and experiment with it next Saturday.
