My resolution for 2013:

> “At least 5 days a week, start my day proactively by doing at least one of these 6 things before looking at my phone: drink a glass of water, stretch, do pushups, do lunges, do plank, review my [Look, Look, Look](http://www.haikudeck.com/p/u9qVHcR7Ts/look-look-look) haiku deck ([background on the fish thing](/2012/10/05/look-look-look)).”

It’s so easy for me to fall into a mindset of reactive responses… I want to make a habit of being proactive every day. Action that starts from my own intentions rather than simply reactions to things that bounce my way.
