A short history of how my <mark><a href="/beliefs">beliefs</a></mark> have moved over the years. You can find every change to every belief between 2012 and 2019 in this [changelog](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/commits/master).

#### [2012](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs-2012.md)

I listed about 40 beliefs the first time I sat down and tried to do this. Organized by subject, like "On Morality", "On Science & the Universe", etc.

#### [2013](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs-2013.md)

It almost doubled in length in the second year to about 70 beliefs. It was still largely tracked on a subject basis.

#### [2014](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs-2014.md)

I added a bunch of stuff to the top and all around the beliefs to better explain the system of tracking beliefs over time and reviewing them frequently. I think I realized at this time just how valuable the project was to my own sense of well-being, and I hoped others would find it useful too. I also added a section for my "favorite ideas" because these too seemed to shift and grow over time in a way that was useful to occasionally review.

#### [2015](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs-2015.md)

I tried something new this year, and attempted to organize by beliefs by the type of belief they were instead of by their subject. I was really interested in understanding the structure of beliefs, and coming up with language to describe how beliefs were shaped in our brains, and how they served different functions. I think this is where I lost a lot of people... whereas before people would see the Codex and say "Wow, I want to make one" now they said "Wwow, that looks complicated. I could never do something like that." 

#### [2016](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs-2016.md)

I stuck with this system for another year, cleaning it up, trying to explain it better and make it feel less intimidating. I continued to add new beliefs and change old ones as well, with the count growing to around 115. But my interests had shifted a bit to cognitive which were one level deeper than beliefs. 

#### [2017](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs-2017.md)

More shuffling, more cleaning up. But I think I saw the writing on the wall this year and realized that this new structure wasn't going to hold where this needed to go. 

#### [2018](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs.md)

I refactored everything to come back to be organized by subject, but kept a bit of structure to separate beliefs that were about how I saw the world, and beliefs about how I thought the would should be. The first set includes beliefs that could potentially be proven wrong with new information, but the second set was more a matter of opinion. This turned out to be really useful in my continued exploration of biases and arguments, because this small difference in the belief makes a bit difference in how you form them, and how you talk about them.

#### 2019

Starts tomorrow, <a href="/beliefs">in a new place</a> (aka here). The subject categories have been cleaned up a bit more, and I've shifted to using tags (marked by emoji) to show how some beliefs are about information (üß† the head), values (‚ù§Ô∏è the heart), and strategy (‚úã the hand). And I also added a üî• tag to any that are particularly sensitive to me, and an indicator for how confident I am in the belief (üí™ or ü§û). 

We'll see where it takes us.
