> The bias against things anyone can have at any time, that nobody can make much money from, because they seem too easy, too obvious, too simple, too cheap. The bias against the following solutions because nobody is marketing or can market them to you for very much profit:

Water

Gardening

Walking

Stretching

Meditation

Sitting in the sun

Fresh air

Curiosity

Vegetables

A good night's sleep

Gratitude

Nature
