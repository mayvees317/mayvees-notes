Effective individual n:

* One who, when driving, gets the green lights
* One who, when joking, throws the punchline
* One who, when debating, persuades
* One who, when socializing, makes the connection
* One who, when working, gets the credit
* One who, when questioned, finds answers
* One who, when gambling, profits
* One who, when in a crowd, is spotted
* One who, when interviewed, gets the offer
* One who, when pressured, delivers
* One who, when in a crowd, is spotted

It's a bottom's up classification. It requires no actual goals to be an effective individual, nor does it require that you actually be skilled since there is a lot of chance involved. You can't argue with results--even when results can't be mapped back to intentions. This is our 21st century hero.
