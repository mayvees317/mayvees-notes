The theme of my 30th birthday, and the following year, was [Higher highs and lower lows](/blog/2006/05-31-higher-highs-lower-lows). 

The theme of my 31st birthday, and the following year, was [Double down](/blog/2007/05-29-double-down). Double down on love, on friends, and on my projects.

This year, I feel like I should shift the focus a bit. Not so much about building building building, and more about enjoying what has been built and what happens to exist. This is a big deal for me cause I almost always feel like I'm not doing enough. That I have to keep being more ambitious, thinking bigger, not getting too lax lest I fall into a rut, etc.

Just as a reminder to myself, I'm gonna re-post my "unified theory of enjoyable living" which I started putting together in January of 2007 and have been adding to and editing since then:

I. IN A NUTSHELL

1. It's not what you do, but how you do it

2. It's not what happens to you, but which qualities it brings out in you

3. Do unto yourself and others always with your best judgment

4. Pursue shared enjoyment

II. PREPARATION

5. Don't dilly dally

6. Don't feel sorry for yourself

7. Exercise, eat healthy, and manage stress

8. Dress and appear as your best self

9. Strive to know yourself

10. Tell people about yourself

11. Appreciate your different energy levels and moods

12. Notice body language

13. Keep your word

14. Be the change you want to see in the world

15. Harness the ability to focus your attention

16. Be a beacon of strength

III. EXECUTION

17. Try to have good intentions

18. Be the maker of your own meaning

19. Participate in extraordinary problems

20. Explore all options and hedge bets while exploring

21. Be confidently all-in once a decision has been made

22. Strive for a lifestyle vision

23. Stake your reputation on your vision

24. Invite others to help you

25. Take responsibility and credit for your own failure and success

26. Be comfortable with big failure and big success

IV. CALIBRATION

27. Retry things you don't like or agree with every once in a while

28. Consider criticism from people who know you

29. Listen closely for things you can't easily hear

30. Relax and always give yourself and others a break
