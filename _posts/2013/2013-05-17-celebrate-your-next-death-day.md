Your birthday is the number of years you've been alive (obviously). 

But what if we also celebrated the number of years we estimate to have left?

I created a quick script to calculate your next deathday (when your years remaining hits a round number).  Because your years remaining go down a little slower than your years so far, presuming you don't die, it's going to be different every year. The data comes from the CDC's latest [death report](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm).

If you want me to tell you what your next deathday is, just tweet me your birthday (you have to include the year, month, and day) by replying to the tweet below. I'll try to respond to most within the next day or so.
