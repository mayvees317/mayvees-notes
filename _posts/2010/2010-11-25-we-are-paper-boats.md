I am thankful for the changing nature of the universe, for the fact that every day can surprise me, for the fact that we can improve our own lives, for our autonomy and our interdependence.

In some traditions, people respect the deceased by putting their ashes in little paper boats and releasing them down the river.  I think we should release ourselves in much the same way.  Not because we’re dead, but because we’re changing, every year, month, and day different from the last.  And that’s a good thing.

I’m taking today to appreciate the impermanent and the transient parts of my life, while they’re here.  I’d like to write something meaningful on a piece of imaginary paper, and send it out onto the lake.

Happy Thanksgiving!
