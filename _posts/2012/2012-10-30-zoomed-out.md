My father passed away 19 years ago today.

Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast hard yesterday.

Stepping back and remembering that we're all mortal and fragile can bring us closer together. 

It makes you want to hug your family, your friends, and even random strangers.

It adds a filter of meaning over everything.

The moments are rare when this reality descends on us collectively, so take advantage of it. Use it to up your empathy not only for the people who are near you, but for all people who are face to face with this realization every day.

What if we could always think and act from a place of respecting the big picture, of being zoomed out and seeing the vulnerability of life?

Dad, I miss you.
