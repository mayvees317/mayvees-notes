Weâ€™ve been writing 3 pages every morning for the past week and we want to check in! For one thing, writing has been tough and surprising. Especially when you get a couple pages in, ie. the sweet spot. On this episode we were lucky enough to discuss that with an expert. Buster Benson is a writer and founder of 750words.com, which is a service that has helped half a million people develop a private journaling practice. A morning pages master himself, Buster has been journaling for over a decade. Mary and Mallika talked to Buster about how to get the most out of your writing and have him sign off on the only acceptable situation in which you can talk about yourself in the third person.
