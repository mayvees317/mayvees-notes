**Okay, things are starting to get real.** Today is the day I begin to share a lot more about this book on productive disagreement I spent the last 3+ years writing with the broader world. You all have been patiently hearing about it the whole time, so I want to both thank you and extend deep apologies for the next month or two.

I just added a few things to [this book website](http://busterbenson.com/whyareweyelling):

- Table of contents: 3 misconceptions and 8 things to try.
- A sample of the 100 illustrations I drew for this book.
- 10 hard questions we explore, for example: "How can I avoid being taken advantage of in bad faith conversations?"
- Nice quotes from seriously amazing authors like Seth Godin, Annie Duke, Adam Grant, and many others. I still can't believe these super smart people were so generous with their time to give a complete stranger like myself a boost.

Take a look and if you think of others who might enjoy the book, please share it!
