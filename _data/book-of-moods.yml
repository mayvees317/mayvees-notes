    interpretation: The mountain is the perfect complement to the lake that reflects it's image reversed. The world is now perfectly prepared to support your weaknesses and give you space to express your strengths.  
    advice: The recommendation of this hexagram is to take the initiative to welcome people in and to be vulnerable.

    interpretation: There are some shadows rising and taking shape, intimidating in size like a mountain looming on the horizon. Rather than engaging with these shadows directly, subtly withdraw and watch them, curious about how they evolve, but they're not yet receptive to a dialogue.
    advice: The timing isn't quite right to engage with the growing discomfort. Better to patiently wait for a time when it finds its own voice and speaks up.

    interpretation: The mountain blocks our path, and the small spring at the foot of the mountain gives us false hope that we can make the journey. Together, this suggests that we have a perilous journey ahead of us, and lack the experience needed to make it safely.
    advice: You might be asking the wrong question. Instead of trying to answer this question, consider asking it in a different way, or looking at it from a different angle. If that doesn't help, it might be best to drop the question for now and try again at a later time.

    interpretation: Wind represents activity of the mind, slowly but persistently getting to the heart of something. There may be something that feels a little bit off, but this wind can help it bend back into a more fitting shape if you let it. 
    advice: Don't jump to conclusions. Be patient and stay undecided and open as you gather more raw information and mull things over. Even if that's a bit scary. Only settle on a decision once you feel like you've truly internalized the question from all angles.

    interpretation: The trees in the lake are outgrowing their existing container. There's a lot of pent up energy, and cracks in the wall of the container that are about to bust open with the raw energy of life. 
    advice: The hexagram recommends letting this energy flow by its own power, and following it, because it is mature and ready. It’s time to stop holding back.

    quotes: ['"Whatever happens, keep calm and do what is right." -- D.F. Hook']
    interpretation: A flash of insight has arrived unexpectedly within yourself. If you can deliver it where it needs to go with innocence and integrity as-is, without entangling it in other grievances, resentments, or fears, this could benefit everyone. 
    advice: Don't overthink it. Channel your first instinct with as much innocence and good will as you can. If that's not possible, refrain for a moment from saying anything.

    interpretation: Water extinguishes fire, and fire dries up water. The image of metamorphosis. Each changes the other. Mutually incompatible forces are in dialogue.  
    advice: A big error might have been made, but forgiveness is fully extended after the fact when it turns out to have been a necessary mistake. It's time to grow.

    other_titles: Mutual Alienation, The Symbol of Strangeness and Disunion, The Estranged, Opposites, Polarizing, Alienation, Distant From, Perversion, Disharmony, Separated, Contradiction, Estrangement, Incongruity
    interpretation: The fire is rising and the lake is falling, which represents a growing separation between parties involved. And yet, it's through this separation that collective well-being is preserved, because each is able to move with integrity in their own way.
    advice: Respect alternate points of view. Energy is generated by the tension created by the proximity of fire and water. Channel it creatively rather than destructively. This may not be easy to do, but it is the right thing to do because it will lead to mutual growth.

    other_titles: The Power of the Great, The Symbol of Great Vigor, Persons of Great Authority, Great Strength, Great Invigorating, Great Maturity, Accumulated Force, The Strength of the Mighty, Righteous Power, Excessive Force
    interpretation: The thunder represents movement and the sky represents strength and reach. Together this represents an opportunity to display great power, if you choose to use it. 
    advice: There is great power crackling in your fingertips like lightning bolts. That doesn't necessarily mean that you should use it, but it should at least be acknowledged and considered as something you must manage. Combining this power with equally great wisdom could benefit everyone involved.
